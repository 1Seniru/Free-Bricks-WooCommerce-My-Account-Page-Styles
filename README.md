## 🎁 Free Bricks WooCommerce – My Account Page Styles (CSS)

Hey everyone 👋
Happy **2026 New Year**! 🎉
Sharing a little **CSS help for anyone using WooCommerce with Bricks**.

This is a simple styling setup for the **WooCommerce My Account page**.
It’s **not perfect**, but honestly **200% better than the default** 😄

✅ **Fully responsive** from **desktop down to 375px** (tested on iPhone 6)

### 🔧 How to use

1. Install **WooCommerce**
2. Go to **Pages** → find **My Account**

   * If you don’t see it, **regenerate missing WooCommerce pages**
3. Edit the **My Account** page with **Bricks**
4. Add a **Section**
5. Inside the section, add the **Account Page** element
6. Add the provided **CSS**

> You can place the CSS **anywhere you like**:
>
> * Code Snippets
> * Page Settings
> * Bricks Settings
> * Or any global CSS area
>
> **Recommended:** Load it **only on the My Account page** for better performance 👍

### 🎨 About the CSS

* Uses **CSS variables** → easy color customization
* Includes **8 different color options**

  * Optional ones are **commented out**
  * Just uncomment the one you like 🙂
* Easy to tweak to match your site design

---

### ✨ Extra (Optional)

I also added:

* A **Code Block inside the My Account page**

  * You can see this in the screenshot above as well
* A small **JavaScript snippet**
  → This adds **icons to the My Account navigation** for a cleaner, more modern UI

Hope this helps someone in **2026** 🚀
Feedback, tweaks, and improvements are always welcome 🙌
